# Building a Computer

## Why?

For higher video and image processing speed, better 2k gaming experience and to learn more about the structure of a PC.

## Perparation

### Budget: 3,000 USD

When I first brought this budget to my parent, they refused right away due to high value. After several times rejections, I realized I need not only tell them amount but also list configuration and explained why I need them. Then budget was approved. 
  
#### Configuration List:

CPU: i9 9900k <img src="https://www.scan.co.uk/images/products/2979483-a.jpg" width="20%" height="20%"> Motherboard: Asus Maximus X Formula	<img src="https://c1.neweggimages.com/NeweggImage/ProductImage/13-119-046-V01.jpg" width="20%" height="20%">

Ram: 16g G.Skill Royal 4266hz	<img src="http://www.gskill.com/imgs/pro/8/8420o.png" width="20%" height="20%">
			




Graphic Card:  evga XC RTX 2080ti

Storage: Crucial MX500 1t sata and Samsang 970evo 250g M.2

Power Supply: Corsair RM750x

Case: Corsair SPEC-OMEGA rgb

### Actual Price: 3,200 USD

To improve ventilation, I changed new case, this caused actual expense is higher than budget. Even though, the case is still not right. That is a pity.

## Graphic Card

If the monitor I have is 1080p, a 2070 or even 1060 will be enough for normal gaming without ray tracking. However, my monitor has 2k resolution, which means that at least a 2080 will be needed. In order to keep the game running higher than 70 fps at “Ultra” quality with ray tracking on at 2k resolution, a 2080 ti will be needed.

## Building PC

1.Update bios of motherboard so that i9 can safely work on Z370 motherboard. A 8th gern CPU is needed to get in bios of most of the motherboards

2.Put CPU on motherboard and lock it in place

3.Put RAM on motherboard and lock it in place

4.Unload cooling armer of the motherboard and put M.2 ssd in place

5.Connect jumper wires on motherboard

6.Take the case apart, unload every part that can be unload

7.Lock motherboard and power supply inside the case

8.Connect cables from powersupply to motherboards

9.Put water cooling in place. At this step, I find out that I bought a wrong and poorly designed case, there are no enough space for water cooling to fit on top of the case. Thus, I have to put fans on the side of the case.

10.Connect sata ssd and put it at the backplane of the case

11.Put graphic card on PCIe port and lock the card with case

13.Put all cooling fans in place	<img src="https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/53117802_102223207612612_5378151455276400640_n.jpg?_nc_cat=109&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=1db4176f7fb8ba2bbaa7542b1a2e18d4&oe=5D194B2B" width="15%" height="20%">

14.Test if everything works

15.Connect all other wires and try to put all of them in backplane. This can take hours and need to be very careful. I found out that one of cable from water cooling is broke, so I weld it back together and covered it with hot glue

16.Use a flash drive with windows installer to install windows 10

17.Download all drivers that the computer need and install them
